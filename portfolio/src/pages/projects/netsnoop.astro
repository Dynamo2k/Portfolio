## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Network security professionals need lightweight, customizable tools for packet analysis during penetration testing and security assessments. While Wireshark is industry-standard, there's a need for scriptable, command-line alternatives that integrate into automated workflows.

### Objectives
- Build a high-performance packet analyzer supporting multiple protocols
- Enable real-time capture with custom BPF filtering
- Provide PCAP export compatibility with Wireshark
- Create a tool suitable for both training and professional use

### Target Users
Penetration testers, security researchers, SOC analysts, and cybersecurity students seeking hands-on packet analysis experience.

### My Role
Solo developer — Full architecture, implementation, and documentation.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture
NetSnoop is built on a modular architecture with separate components for packet capture, protocol dissection, filtering, and output formatting. The core engine leverages Scapy's packet manipulation capabilities while adding custom parsing layers for enhanced protocol support.

### Core Features
1. **Multi-protocol support** — IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP
2. **Real-time packet capture and analysis** — Live network interface monitoring
3. **PCAP file export** — Full Wireshark compatibility
4. **Custom BPF filtering** — Berkeley Packet Filter support
5. **Protocol statistics and visualization** — Matplotlib-powered charts

### Implementation Highlights
- Scapy library for deep packet dissection
- Multi-threaded packet processing for high-speed networks
- Efficient memory management with ring buffer implementation
- Custom protocol parsers for edge-case handling

```python
# Example: Custom packet handler
def packet_handler(packet):
    if packet.haslayer(TCP):
        analyze_tcp(packet)
    elif packet.haslayer(UDP):
        analyze_udp(packet)
    # Process and display packet info
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Optimization
- **Problem:** Packet loss at high network speeds
- **Solution:** Implemented multi-threaded processing and efficient buffering
- **Result:** Reduced packet loss from 15% to less than 2%

### Challenge 2: Protocol Parsing Accuracy
- **Problem:** Complex protocol variations causing misidentification
- **Solution:** Robust error handling and fallback parsing mechanisms
- **Result:** 99%+ accurate protocol identification

### Lessons Learned
If starting over, I would implement an async event-driven architecture from the beginning rather than retrofitting threading. I would also add plugin support for custom protocol parsers.
