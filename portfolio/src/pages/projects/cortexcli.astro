## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Security professionals often switch between multiple tools during assessments and incident response. There's a need for an intelligent command-line interface that understands security context and can assist with common security operations through AI-powered recommendations.

### Objectives
- Create an AI-integrated command-line shell for security operations
- Implement intelligent command suggestions based on security context
- Build a fast, low-overhead tool in C for system-level performance
- Provide seamless integration with existing security workflows

### Target Users
Security professionals, SOC analysts, and penetration testers who work extensively in terminal environments.

### My Role
Solo developer — Architecture design, C implementation, and AI integration.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture
CortexCLI is built as a custom shell in C with an AI integration layer. The core shell handles command parsing, process management, and I/O operations, while the AI module provides intelligent suggestions and security context awareness.

### Core Features
1. **Custom Shell Implementation** — Full-featured command-line interface built in C
2. **AI-Powered Suggestions** — Intelligent command recommendations
3. **Security Context Awareness** — Understands security operation workflows
4. **Low Overhead** — Native C performance for resource-constrained environments
5. **Extensible Architecture** — Plugin system for custom security modules

### Implementation Highlights
- Custom shell parser with support for pipes, redirections, and job control
- AI integration through API calls for contextual suggestions
- Memory-safe coding practices with careful resource management
- POSIX-compliant for cross-platform Linux compatibility

```c
// Example: Command parsing with AI context
void process_command(char *input) {`{`}
    Command *cmd = parse_input(input);
    if (cmd->needs_ai_assist) {`{`}
        char *suggestion = get_ai_suggestion(cmd);
        display_suggestion(suggestion);
    {`}`}
    execute_command(cmd);
{`}`}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Memory Management
- **Problem:** Complex string operations and dynamic memory allocation in C
- **Solution:** Implemented custom memory pool allocator and strict ownership semantics
- **Result:** Zero memory leaks verified through Valgrind

### Challenge 2: AI Integration in C
- **Problem:** AI APIs typically target Python/JS; C integration is uncommon
- **Solution:** Built custom HTTP client in C using libcurl for API communication
- **Result:** Seamless AI integration with minimal latency

### Lessons Learned
Working with C for this project deepened my understanding of systems programming and forced me to think carefully about memory safety. This experience directly translates to understanding buffer overflows and memory corruption vulnerabilities in security work.
