## How It All Started

My cybersecurity journey began with a simple question: "How do hackers actually break into systems?" This curiosity led me to TryHackMe, a platform that would fundamentally shape my career path. When I first created my account, I had basic Linux knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm — but not much else.

Fast forward to today, I'm ranked in the top 4% globally on TryHackMe, having completed over 70 rooms across multiple learning paths. Here's how I got there and what I learned along the way.

## My Learning Path

### Phase 1: The Fundamentals (Months 1-3)

I started with the **Pre-Security** and **Introduction to Cyber Security** paths. These rooms covered:

- Basic networking (OSI model, TCP/IP, subnetting)
- Linux fundamentals (file system, permissions, bash)
- Windows basics (Active Directory, PowerShell)
- Web fundamentals (HTTP, DNS, HTML/CSS)

**Key tip:** Don't rush through these. A strong foundation makes everything else easier.

### Phase 2: Offensive Security (Months 3-6)

This is where things got exciting. I dove into the **Jr Penetration Tester** and **Offensive Pentesting** paths:

- Nmap scanning and enumeration
- Web application attacks (SQLi, XSS, IDOR)
- Privilege escalation (Linux and Windows)
- Metasploit Framework
- Buffer overflows

### Phase 3: Defensive Security (Months 6-9)

With a solid offensive foundation, I shifted to the defensive side:

- SOC Level 1 path
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis basics
- SIEM fundamentals

### Phase 4: Advanced Rooms (Months 9-12)

This phase included the most challenging rooms:

- Active Directory attacks and defense
- Advanced privilege escalation
- Custom exploit development
- Red team operations

## Favorite Rooms and Why

1. **Buffer Overflow Prep** — This room completely demystified buffer overflows for me. The step-by-step approach made a complex topic accessible.

2. **Advent of Cyber 2024** — A fantastic event that covered a wide range of topics in a fun, gamified format. I earned my completion certificate.

3. **Attacking Active Directory** — Essential for understanding enterprise environments. The skills from this room directly apply to real-world penetration testing.

4. **Volatility** — Memory forensics is fascinating. This room taught me to extract evidence from memory dumps, a skill I use in my SOC analyst role.

5. **MITRE ATT&CK** — Understanding the ATT&CK framework through practical exercises changed how I think about threats.

## Challenges That Taught Me the Most

The rooms that frustrated me the most taught me the most. There were nights where I'd spend hours stuck on a single challenge, only to realize I was overthinking it. The biggest lesson? **Enumerate harder.** In almost every case where I was stuck, the answer was better enumeration.

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Be consistent** — 1 hour daily beats 10 hours once a week
2. **Take notes** — I use Obsidian to document every room
3. **Don't rely on write-ups** — Struggle with challenges before looking at solutions
4. **Join the community** — The TryHackMe Discord is incredibly helpful
5. **Apply what you learn** — Build labs, create tools, write about your experiences
6. **Track your progress** — Seeing improvement over time keeps you motivated

## How TryHackMe Helped My Career

The skills I developed on TryHackMe directly contributed to:

- Landing my SOC Analyst position at the National Center of Cyber Security
- Performing effectively in penetration testing engagements at ZeroxInnovation
- Winning cybersecurity competitions (1st Place at Air University CTF)
- Building security tools like NetSnoop, SSHield, and CortexCLI

## Conclusion

Reaching the top 4% on TryHackMe wasn't about being the smartest person in the room — it was about consistency, curiosity, and refusing to give up. If you're starting your cybersecurity journey, I encourage you to create a TryHackMe account today and start with the basics. Your future self will thank you.
