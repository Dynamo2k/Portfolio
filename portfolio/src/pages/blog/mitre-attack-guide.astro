## Understanding MITRE ATT&CK

The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework is one of the most valuable resources for security professionals. It provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

As a SOC Analyst at the National Center of Cyber Security, I use ATT&CK daily for threat detection, incident analysis, and building detection rules. In this guide, I'll share practical approaches to leveraging ATT&CK in SOC operations.

## The ATT&CK Matrix Structure

The framework is organized into three main components:

1. **Tactics** — The adversary's tactical goals (the "why")
2. **Techniques** — How the adversary achieves those goals (the "how")
3. **Procedures** — Specific implementations by threat actors

### Key Tactics

| Tactic | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Initial Access | Gaining entry to the network | Phishing, exploiting public-facing apps |
| Execution | Running malicious code | PowerShell, command-line scripts |
| Persistence | Maintaining access | Registry run keys, scheduled tasks |
| Privilege Escalation | Gaining higher permissions | Token manipulation, exploitation |
| Defense Evasion | Avoiding detection | Obfuscation, disabling security tools |
| Credential Access | Stealing credentials | Keylogging, credential dumping |
| Discovery | Understanding the environment | Network scanning, file enumeration |
| Lateral Movement | Moving through the network | RDP, SMB, pass-the-hash |
| Exfiltration | Stealing data | Encrypted channels, cloud storage |
| Impact | Disrupting operations | Ransomware, data destruction |

## How I Use ATT&CK in SOC Work

### 1. Threat Detection

Every detection rule I write maps to at least one ATT&CK technique. This ensures comprehensive coverage and helps identify gaps:

```yaml
# Example Wazuh rule mapped to ATT&CK
# Technique: T1059.001 (PowerShell)
# Tactic: Execution

rule:
  id: 100100
  level: 12
  description: "Suspicious PowerShell execution detected"
  mitre:
    tactic: Execution
    id: T1059.001
    technique: "Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell"
  match:
    - "powershell.exe -encodedcommand"
    - "powershell.exe -enc"
    - "powershell.exe -e "
```

### 2. Incident Analysis

When analyzing an incident, I map observed activities to ATT&CK techniques to build a complete picture of the attack:

```
Incident Timeline (ATT&CK Mapped):

1. T1566.001 (Phishing: Spear-phishing Attachment)
   → User opened malicious PDF attachment

2. T1059.001 (PowerShell)
   → Payload executed via PowerShell

3. T1547.001 (Registry Run Keys)
   → Persistence established via registry modification

4. T1003.001 (LSASS Memory)
   → Credential dumping via Mimikatz

5. T1021.001 (Remote Desktop Protocol)
   → Lateral movement to server via RDP

6. T1048.003 (Exfiltration Over Unencrypted Protocol)
   → Data exfiltrated via HTTP
```

### 3. Gap Analysis

I regularly compare our detection coverage against the ATT&CK matrix to identify blind spots:

```
Coverage Analysis Example:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Tactic              Coverage
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Initial Access       85%
Execution            90%
Persistence          75% ← Gap identified
Privilege Esc.       70% ← Gap identified
Defense Evasion      60% ← Priority gap
Credential Access    80%
Lateral Movement     65% ← Gap identified
Exfiltration         55% ← Priority gap
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Integration with SIEM Platforms

### Wazuh Integration

Wazuh natively supports MITRE ATT&CK mapping in its rule engine:

```xml
<rule id="100200" level="10">
  <if_sid>60106</if_sid>
  <field name="win.eventdata.commandLine">
    certutil\.exe.*-urlcache
  </field>
  <description>Certutil used for file download (T1105)</description>
  <mitre>
    <id>T1105</id>
  </mitre>
</rule>
```

### Splunk Integration

In Splunk, I use the Enterprise Security framework with ATT&CK annotations:

```spl
| tstats count FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  WHERE Processes.process_name="powershell.exe"
  BY Processes.process_name Processes.process
| lookup mitre_attack_lookup technique_id AS process_technique
| table _time process_name technique_name tactic
```

## Threat Hunting with ATT&CK

ATT&CK-based threat hunting follows a hypothesis-driven approach:

1. **Select a technique** — e.g., T1003 (OS Credential Dumping)
2. **Form a hypothesis** — "An adversary may be dumping credentials via LSASS"
3. **Identify data sources** — Process creation logs, Sysmon events
4. **Build queries** — Search for indicators of the technique
5. **Analyze results** — Investigate any suspicious findings
6. **Document findings** — Update detection rules and playbooks

### Example Hunt Query

```spl
# Hunting for LSASS memory access (T1003.001)
index=sysmon EventCode=10 TargetImage="*lsass.exe"
| stats count by SourceImage, SourceUser
| where count > 1
| sort - count
```

## Real-world Application

In my daily SOC work, I recently used ATT&CK to analyze a suspected intrusion:

1. Alert triggered on unusual PowerShell activity (T1059.001)
2. Investigation revealed encoded commands downloading additional payloads (T1105)
3. Persistence mechanism found via scheduled task (T1053.005)
4. Network analysis showed C2 communication over HTTPS (T1071.001)
5. Full ATT&CK mapping provided to management for threat briefing

This structured approach helped communicate the severity and scope of the threat effectively.

## Conclusion

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is not just a theoretical reference — it's a practical tool that enhances every aspect of SOC operations. By mapping detections, analyzing incidents, and hunting for threats through the lens of ATT&CK, security teams can achieve more comprehensive and systematic defense.

I recommend every SOC analyst to invest time in understanding ATT&CK deeply. It will transform how you approach threat detection and incident response.
