## HackTheBox Experience

Achieving Top 900 ranking on HackTheBox required consistent practice and a systematic approach to machine exploitation.

## Approach

### Reconnaissance
Detailed scanning and enumeration of target machines using nmap, gobuster, and custom scripts.

### Web Application Testing
Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, particularly injection attacks, authentication bypasses, and server-side request forgery.

### Privilege Escalation
Linux and Windows privilege escalation techniques including kernel exploits, misconfigurations, and service abuse.

## Lessons Learned

- Patience is key - some machines take hours of enumeration
- Always check for custom applications and unusual services
- Kernel exploits should be a last resort
- Documentation and note-taking are essential skills
