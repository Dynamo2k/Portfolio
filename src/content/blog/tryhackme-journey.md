## The Journey

When I first started on TryHackMe, I had basic knowledge of Linux and networking. Over the course of several months of dedicated practice, I climbed to the top 4% globally.

## Favorite Rooms

### Beginner Rooms
- **Basic Pentesting**: Great introduction to enumeration
- **Blue**: Windows exploitation fundamentals
- **Kenobi**: Linux privilege escalation

### Intermediate Rooms
- **Buffer Overflow Prep**: Essential for OSCP preparation
- **Active Directory**: Enterprise environment attacks
- **Threat Intelligence**: SOC-focused room

### Advanced Rooms
- **Hacking with PowerShell**: Advanced Windows post-exploitation
- **Red Team Engagements**: Full red team methodology

## Key Strategies

1. **Consistency over intensity** - Practice daily, even if just 30 minutes
2. **Take notes** - Document every room and technique
3. **Build your methodology** - Create a systematic approach to each challenge
4. **Learn the fundamentals** - Networking and Linux are the foundation
5. **Join the community** - Discord and forums are invaluable resources

## Impact on My Career

The skills I developed on TryHackMe directly translated to my roles as SOC Analyst at NCCS and Penetration Tester at ZeroxInnovation.
