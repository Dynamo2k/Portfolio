## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
SSH is a critical service on virtually every Linux server, yet it's frequently misconfigured and targeted by attackers. Organizations need automated tools to audit SSH configurations, detect brute-force attacks, and enforce security best practices.

### Objectives
- Create a comprehensive SSH security toolkit for hardening and monitoring
- Automate SSH configuration auditing against security benchmarks
- Detect and alert on brute-force authentication attempts
- Provide remediation guidance for identified issues

### Target Users
System administrators, security engineers, and SOC analysts responsible for maintaining secure SSH access across infrastructure.

### My Role
Solo developer — Full architecture, implementation, and security research.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture
SSHield operates as a multi-module toolkit with separate components for configuration auditing, log analysis, brute-force detection, and reporting. Each module can operate independently or as part of an integrated security assessment.

### Core Features
1. **Configuration Auditing** — Automated SSH config analysis against CIS benchmarks
2. **Brute-Force Detection** — Real-time monitoring of authentication attempts
3. **Key Management** — SSH key rotation and strength analysis
4. **Log Analysis** — Parse and analyze SSH authentication logs
5. **Security Reporting** — Generate comprehensive security assessment reports

### Implementation Highlights
- Regex-based log parsing optimized for high-volume environments
- CIS Benchmark integration for SSH hardening standards
- IP reputation checking for detected attackers
- Configurable alerting thresholds and notification channels
- JSON/HTML report generation

```python
# Example: Brute-force detection
def analyze_auth_logs(log_file):
    failed_attempts = {`{}`}
    for line in parse_log(log_file):
        if "Failed password" in line:
            ip = extract_ip(line)
            failed_attempts[ip] = failed_attempts.get(ip, 0) + 1
            if failed_attempts[ip] > THRESHOLD:
                alert_brute_force(ip, failed_attempts[ip])
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Log Volume Processing
- **Problem:** High-traffic servers generate massive authentication logs
- **Solution:** Implemented streaming log parser with configurable window sizes
- **Result:** Processes 100K+ log entries per second

### Challenge 2: False Positive Reduction
- **Problem:** Legitimate users occasionally trigger brute-force alerts
- **Solution:** Implemented behavioral analysis with whitelisting and adaptive thresholds
- **Result:** Reduced false positives by 85%

### Lessons Learned
Building SSHield reinforced the importance of defense-in-depth. Understanding SSH security from both offensive and defensive perspectives makes the toolkit more effective. The experience directly applies to my SOC analyst role in detecting and responding to SSH-based attacks.
